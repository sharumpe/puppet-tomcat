  "description": "Manages tomcat (version 6 or 7) in /etc/tomcat(6). This has defined types for tomcat-users.xml's roles and users, context.xml parameters, and most-used settings in server.xml.  Also configures JAVA_OPTS and CATALINA_OPTS in tomcat(6).conf.  This does NOT restart Tomcat on config file changes.  Now provides for setting up GlobalNamingResources in server.xml, specifically DBCP data sources.",
